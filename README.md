# Today I Learned

This is a repo to share my learnings everyday.

TILs are short Markdown documents (a few sentences + example code) explaining a

new concept, bit of syntax, command, or tip that I've learned.

The idea of writing TIL is inspired by @thoughtbot.

It is easier than writing blog. :P
