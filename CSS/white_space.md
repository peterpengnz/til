## White Space

One day I noticed I am still use `wrap` attribute for `text_area`.

It is better to take a note here today to remind myself that I could use `white-space` css property.

MDN has a great summary about this css property.

Check it out [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/white-space).
